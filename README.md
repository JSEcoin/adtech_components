# JSE AdTech UI Components

**[JSECOIN](https://jsecoin.com/)** [THE FUTURE BLOCKCHAIN & ECOSYSTEM FOR ECOMMERCE AND DIGITAL ADVERTISING]

## WARNING

We are still working on the interface and know there are still a number of bugs and cross browser issues - please be patient.. 

## Overview

Our adtech components for review are available here

## Demo

## Technology:

JSE Ad Tech Components have been built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
